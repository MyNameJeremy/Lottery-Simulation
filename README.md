# Lottery-Simulation
This program can simulate a number of drawings in the Lottery (6 out of 49). The guesses and the draws are chosen randomly and the user can choose how many right guesses there should be (0-6). Then the program will run through the simulation as many times as it takes to get the exact number of correct guesses the user chose. The user can also choose how many times this should be repeated (the higher the number, the more accurate the result will be). Then the program will automatically calculate the average number of tries it took to get the chosen number of correct guesses and tell the user the chance of getting this certain number of correct guesses.
